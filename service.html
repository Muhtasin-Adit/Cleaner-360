                <div class="pra2">
                    <p> Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects.
                         The recovery of energy from waste materials is often included in this concept.
                          The recyclability of a material depends on its ability to reacquire the properties it had in its original state.
                           It is an alternative to "conventional" waste disposal that can save material and help lower greenhouse gas emissions.
                            It can also prevent the waste of potentially useful materials and reduce the consumption of fresh raw materials, 
                            reducing energy use, air pollution (from incineration) and water pollution (from landfilling).

                <h5>Reuse</h5>
                <div class="pra2">
                    <p>Reuse is the action or practice of using an item, whether for its original purpose (conventional reuse)
                         or to fulfill a different function (creative reuse or repurposing). It should be distinguished from recycling,
                          which is the breaking down of used items to make raw materials for the manufacture of new products.
                           Reuse  by taking, but not reprocessing, previously used items 
                            helps save time, money, energy and resources. In broader economic terms,
                            it can make quality products available to people and organizations with limited means,
                            while generating jobs and business activity that contribute to the economy.

                <div class="pra2">
                    <p> Rethinking, reconsidering, or reconsideration, is the process of reviewing a decision or conclusion that has previously been made to determine whether the initial decision should be changed. Rethinking can occur immediately after a decision has been reached, or at any time thereafter. Informally, reconsidering a decision shortly after making it and before taking any action towards
                        implementing it may be referred to as thinking twice or thinking again (most often phrased in the imperative, think twice or think again).

                <div class="pra2">
                    <p>Reform means the improvement or amendment of what is wrong, corrupt, unsatisfactory, etc. The use of the word in this way emerges in the late 18th century and is believed to originate from which identified “Parliamentary Reform” as its primary aim. Reform is generally regarded as antithetical to revolution. Developing countries may carry out a wide range of reforms to improve their living standards, often with support from international financial institutions and
                        aid agencies. This can include reforms to macroeconomic policy, the civil service,
                        and public financial management.
